DESCRIPTION
    An implimentation of the Mayan Long Count Calendar as defined in
    "Calendrical Calculations The Millenium Edition".

METHODS
    * new( %hash )
        Accepts a hash repressenting the number of days since the Mayan
        epoch.

           The units are:
           kin   = 1 day
           uinal = 20 days
           tun   = 360 days
           katun = 7200 days
           katun = 144000 days

        In the future pictuns, calabtuns, kinchiltuns, and alautuns may be
        accepted.

    * now
        Alternate constructor. Uses DateTime->now to set the current date.

    * from_object( object => $object, ... )
        Accepts a "DateTime::Calendar" object.

        Note: Currently the seconds value return by utc_rd_values is
        ignored. The language parameter is also ignored.

    * utc_rd_values
        Returns the current UTC Rata Die days and seconds as a two element
        list.

        Note: Currently the seconds count returned is always zero.

        Think DateTime::ymd. Like ymd this method also accepts an optionl
        field seperator string.
